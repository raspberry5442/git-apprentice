This error message is telling you that the branch you are trying to push, "fix-bugs-D", has changes that are not present in the corresponding branch on the remote repository, "feature-D". This is because another user may have pushed changes to the remote repository since you last pulled changes.

To resolve this issue, you should first pull the changes from the remote repository using the following command:

```shell
git pull origin feature-D
```

This will bring any changes from the remote repository into your local branch. After resolving any conflicts and committing any changes, you can then push your changes to the remote repository using the following command:

```shell
git push origin fix-bugs-D
```

Alternatively, if you are sure that your changes should overwrite the remote branch, you can force push your changes using the following command:

```shell
git push -f origin fix-bugs-D
```

However, you should use this option with caution, as it can overwrite changes made by other users and lead to data loss. It is generally better to pull changes from the remote repository and resolve any conflicts before pushing your changes.
